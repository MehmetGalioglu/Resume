# Projects 


## API/UI Hybrid Test Automation 

- In this project, I created a UI automation framework, using ***Selenium & Cucumber***.
- By implementing the ***Page Object Model (POM)*** design pattern, created separate page objects for each page, ensuring a modular and maintainable test framework. 
- Additionally, I wrote step classes that seamlessly integrated the methods within the page objects with the ***Cucumber*** steps, enhancing the readability and reusability of the test scripts.
- This project is build using basic principles of ***OOP***, combines ***BDD*** with Selenium to test integrity of the website.
- The modular structure of the framework makes it highly scalable, allowing for seamless expansion of future tests on this specific website.

## API Automation

- This project is an API service that interacts with the PetStore database to perform various CRUD operations. The API service provides a convenient and easy-to-use interface for managing the database. 
- Additionally, this project serves as a valuable template for future API automation projects. Its comprehensive functionality make it an ideal starting point for building similar solutions, saving time and effort in development.

## Open-Source Project Contributions

- ***[Pickleib](https://github.com/Umutayb/Pickleib)***
  - Improved documentation, added new methods, property configurations and scalability for future upgrades.
  - A MongoDB database was created containing methods and documentation of the Pickleib library. 
  - Added chat support functionality. This feature leverages the OpenAI API and MongoDB Atlas API services along with the GPT utilities library. By seamlessly integrating chatGPT with the MongoDB database, the chat support feature provides a dynamic and engaging environment for users. This allows them to get support and retrieve method information and application examples from the Pickleib library.
 
- ***[GPT-Utilities](https://github.com/Umutayb/GPT-Utilities)***
  - This library utilizes the OpenAI API service to provide inner GPT functionality for Java projects.
  - It offers various features such as chat support, data generation, and more, which can be seamlessly integrated into any Java project.
  - I established the initial framework and set up the foundation for API usage. Additionally, I provided support throughout the development process.

- ***[Java-Utilities](https://github.com/Umutayb/Java-Utilities)***
  - To clarify usage I create documentation, specify additional descriptions and ensure that it is comprehensive and effortless for users to understand.
  - Added new methods to the library. These enhancements aimed to extend the functionality and practicality of the Java Utilities library and to provide end users with more alternatives and efficiencies when working with Java applications.

- ***[Web-Automation-Sample-Cucumber](https://github.com/Umutayb/Web-Automation-Sample-Cucumber)***
  - This project is a template demonstrating designed usage of Pickleib test automation library. The template can be used for quick initialisation of test automation projects.
  - I expanded the versatility of the project by adding new test scenarios that encompass both UI and API testing. These additional scenarios allowed for a more comprehensive and thorough testing approach, catering to different aspects of web application testing.
