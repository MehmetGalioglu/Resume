## About

Enthusiastic Test Automation Engineer with a solid foundation in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and intermediate Java experience. 

Under the guidance of professional test automation engineers, I had opportunity to develop a solid skill set in test automation within the Java OOP framework. 
I have been developing expertise in Selenium for web automation, Cucumber BDD Framework, Page Object Model and dependency management with Maven.
I have successfully implemented common testing practices such as test execution with BDD, and application of object oriented programming in test automation. 

My skills extend to API testing, where I have hands-on experience in backend testing and end-to-end testing.

Thanks to guidance of professional test automation engineers, I developed healty coding practices, always aiming for writing readeble, modular and scalable code. 

Quality Assurance (QA) is one of the most important aspects of the Software Development Life Cycle, and I am passionate about developing expertise in this field. <br>

# Projects

In this project, I designed a test automation to execute end to end testing of DemoQA Bookstore Application using ***Cucumber BDD Framework*** and ***POM Design Pattern***. In the first part of the project, I sent Api requests to create a user and add some books to the user account. In the second part, Api responses are verified over the UI of the application. In this project every change can be contoroled over the cucumber steps. Therefore it is a scalable and sustainable project.

In this project, I created a UI automation framework, using ***Selenium & Cucumber***. I applied ***POM Design pattern***, creating page objects for each page, and creating corresponding step classes which connects the methods inside page objects to the ***Cucumber*** steps by instantiating the class object of the page. This project was build using basic principles of ***OOP***, combines ***BDD*** with Selenium to test integrity of the website. Therefore this project is scalable for future tests on this specific website.
