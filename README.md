## About

Skilled Test Automation Engineer with a solid foundation in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and intermediate Java experience. I discovered programming and was intrigued by its potential, and later discovered software automation, which I found to be incredibly versatile and efficient. I taught myself automation and learned fundamentals of testing. I have studied and successfully combined common test automation practices such as test execution with BDD, and application of object oriented programming in test automation I have successfully contributed to test automation projects, demonstrating expertise in Maven dependency management, Selenium for web automation, and Cucumber BDD Framework for efficient test scenario design and execution.

My skills extend to API testing, where I have hands-on experience with Retrofit2 and OkHttp for communication and validation. I bring a proactive approach to problem-solving, ensuring reliable automated test suites that enhance the overall software quality .  <br>

# Projects 


## API/UI Hybrid Test Automation 

- In this project, I created a UI automation framework, using ***Selenium & Cucumber***.
- By implementing the ***Page Object Model (POM)*** design pattern, created separate page objects for each page, ensuring a modular and maintainable test framework. 
- Additionally, I wrote step classes that seamlessly integrated the methods within the page objects with the ***Cucumber*** steps, enhancing the readability and reusability of the test scripts.
- This project is build using basic principles of ***OOP***, combines ***BDD*** with Selenium to test integrity of the website.
- The modular structure of the framework makes it highly scalable, allowing for seamless expansion of future tests on this specific website.

## Open-Source Project Contributions

- ***[Pickleib](https://github.com/Umutayb/Pickleib)***
  - Improved documentation, added new methods, property configurations and scalability for future upgrades.
  - A MongoDB database was created containing methods and documentation of the Pickleib library. 
  - Added chat support functionality. This feature leverages the OpenAI API and MongoDB Atlas API services along with the GPT utilities library. By seamlessly integrating chatGPT with the MongoDB database, the chat support feature provides a dynamic and engaging environment for users. This allows them to get support and retrieve method information and application examples from the Pickleib library.
 
- ***[GPT-Utilities](https://github.com/Umutayb/GPT-Utilities)***
  - This library utilizes the OpenAI API service to provide inner GPT functionality for Java projects.
  - It offers various features such as chat support, data generation, and more, which can be seamlessly integrated into any Java project.
  - I established the initial framework and set up the foundation for API usage. Additionally, I provided support throughout the development process.

- ***[Java-Utilities](https://github.com/Umutayb/Java-Utilities)***
  - To clarify usage I create documentation, specify additional descriptions and ensure that it is comprehensive and effortless for users to understand.
  - Added new methods to the library. These enhancements aimed to extend the functionality and practicality of the Java Utilities library and to provide end users with more alternatives and efficiencies when working with Java applications.

- ***[Web-Automation-Sample-Cucumber](https://github.com/Umutayb/Web-Automation-Sample-Cucumber)***
  - This project is a template demonstrating designed usage of Pickleib test automation library. The template can be used for quick initialisation of test automation projects.
  - I expanded the versatility of the project by adding new test scenarios that encompass both UI and API testing. These additional scenarios allowed for a more comprehensive and thorough testing approach, catering to different aspects of web application testing.
