## About

Skilled Test Automation Engineer with a solid foundation in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and intermediate Java experience. I discovered programming and was intrigued by its potential, and later discovered software automation, which I found to be incredibly versatile and efficient. I taught myself automation and learned fundamentals of testing. I have studied and successfully combined common test automation practices such as test execution with BDD, and application of object oriented programming in test automation I have successfully contributed to test automation projects, demonstrating expertise in Maven dependency management, Selenium for web automation, and Cucumber BDD Framework for efficient test scenario design and execution.

My skills extend to API testing, where I have hands-on experience with Retrofit2 and OkHttp for communication and validation. I bring a proactive approach to problem-solving, ensuring reliable automated test suites that enhance the overall software quality.  <br>

# Projects

In this project, I created a UI automation framework, using ***Selenium & Cucumber***. I applied ***POM Design pattern***, creating page objects for each page, and writing step classes which bined the methods inside page objects to the ***Cucumber*** steps by instantiating the class object of the page. This project is build using basic principles of ***OOP***, combines ***BDD*** with Selenium to test integrity of the website. Therefore this project is scalible for future tests on this specific website.
