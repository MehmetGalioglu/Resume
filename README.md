## About

Skilled Test Automation Engineer with a solid foundation in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and intermediate Java experience. I discovered programming and was intrigued by its potential, and later discovered software automation, which I found to be incredibly versatile and efficient. I taught myself automation and learned fundamentals of testing. I have studied and successfully combined common test automation practices such as test execution with BDD, and application of object oriented programming in test automation I have successfully contributed to test automation projects, demonstrating expertise in Maven dependency management, Selenium for web automation, and Cucumber BDD Framework for efficient test scenario design and execution.

My skills extend to API testing, where I have hands-on experience with Retrofit2 and OkHttp for communication and validation. I bring a proactive approach to problem-solving, ensuring reliable automated test suites that enhance the overall software quality .  <br>

# Projects 


## API/UI Hybrid Test Automation 

- In this project, I created a UI automation framework, using ***Selenium & Cucumber***.
- By implementing the ***Page Object Model (POM)*** design pattern, created separate page objects for each page, ensuring a modular and maintainable test framework. 
- Additionally, I wrote step classes that seamlessly integrated the methods within the page objects with the ***Cucumber*** steps, enhancing the readability and reusability of the test scripts.
- This project is build using basic principles of ***OOP***, combines ***BDD*** with Selenium to test integrity of the website.
- The modular structure of the framework makes it highly scalable, allowing for seamless expansion of future tests on this specific website.

## API Automation

- This project is an API service that interacts with the PetStore database to perform various CRUD operations. The API service provides a convenient and easy-to-use interface for managing the database. 
- Additionally, this project serves as a valuable template for future API automation projects. Its comprehensive functionality make it an ideal starting point for building similar solutions, saving time and effort in development.

- ***[Web-Automation-Sample-Cucumber](https://github.com/Umutayb/Web-Automation-Sample-Cucumber)***
  - This project is a template demonstrating designed usage of Pickleib test automation library. The template can be used for quick initialisation of test automation projects.
  - I expanded the versatility of the project by adding new test scenarios that encompass both UI and API testing. These additional scenarios allowed for a more comprehensive and thorough testing approach, catering to different aspects of web application testing.
